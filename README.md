# Arduino-MIDI-Drum
In this project, we aimed to create a simple electronic drum that anyone could build using hardware such as a microcontroller, piezo sensors, resistors, and the softwares hairless-midiserial and loopMIDI.The hardware is designed in such a way that, in order to simulate a drum set, piezo sensors are used to represent the cymbals and drums, which produce a voltage when struck.The microcontroller reads this voltage to generate the note that each piezo sensor represents.
